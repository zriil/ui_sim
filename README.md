## 🧩 Adding Routes
To add new routes to the application, update the `lib/routes/app_routes.dart` file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:package_name/presentation/home_screen/home_screen.dart';

class AppRoutes {
  static const String initial = '/';
  static const String home = '/home';

  static Map<String, WidgetBuilder> routes = {
    initial: (context) => const SplashScreen(),
    home: (context) => const HomeScreen(),
    // Add more routes as needed
  }
}
```
## 🎨 Theming

This project includes a comprehensive theming system with both light and dark themes:

```dart
// Access the current theme
ThemeData get theme => ThemeHelper().themeData();

// Use colors
color: theme.colorScheme.primary,
```

## 📱 Responsive Design
The app is built with responsive design using the SizeUtils:

```dart
// Example of responsive sizing
Container(
  width: 50.h,
  height: 20.h,
  child: Text('Responsive Container'),
)
```
## 📦 Deployment
Build the application for production:

```bash
# For Android
flutter build apk --release

# For iOS

```
